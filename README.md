In our last project exam, the assignment was to create a front end for an existing Social Media company. Some essential features had to be included, but the design and user experience were not specified. Noroff gave us an API that we would work with to build a modern front-end social media application.

## Description

In our last project, we were to take all the skills we had learned in the previous two years and do an extensive project to show our skills.

We were to make a front end for an existing social media company and a brand new front end for their application. There was a list of required features, but the design and user experience needed to be specified.

The API used in this project can [be found here](https://noroff-api-docs.netlify.app/)

The most important requirements we had to follow were this:

1. A user with a `stud.noroff.no` email may register
2. A registered user may login
3. A registered user may update their avatar and banner
4. A registered user may logout
5. A registered user may view a list of `Posts`
6. A registered user may view a list of `Profiles`
7. A registered user may view a single `Post` by `id`
8. A registered user may view a single `Profile` by `name`
9. A registered user may create a `Post`
10. A registered user may update a `Post` they own
11. A registered user may delete a `Post` they own
12. A registered user may create a `Comment` on any `Post`
13. A registered user may `react` to any `Post` with an emoji
14. A registered user may `follow` and `unfollow` another `Profile`

All of these requirements were fulfilled in the final product.
